# Overview: Lab 1 Installing VirtualBox and Server 2022
Welcome to the first lab of my home lab series! This section of my home lab documentation focuses on the process of installing VirtualBox and setting up a Windows Server 2022 virtual machine within the VirtualBox environment. It outlines the steps for downloading and installing VirtualBox, followed by the creation of a virtual machine to host Windows Server 2022. The project also covers the configuration of basic server settings and prepares the server for further roles, such as Active Directory and domain controller setup. This task serves as the foundation for building a virtualized lab environment that mimics real-world IT infrastructure, ideal for practicing administrative tasks and learning server management techniques.

# Objectives
This repository documents a comprehensive home lab project focused on installing and configuring VirtualBox and Windows Server 2022. The key objectives include:

Demonstrating the setup and installation process of VirtualBox as a virtualization platform.
Installing and configuring Windows Server 2022 in a virtualized environment.
Creating a foundation for further experiments involving Active Directory, system administration, and IT operations.
Documentation
In this documentation, I will outline the initial steps of setting up my Active Directory home lab. This includes downloading and preparing the essential tools: VirtualBox and Windows Server 2022.

To start, we’ll download VirtualBox from the official website at https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads. Since I’m using a Windows PC, I will be selecting the version for Windows hosts.
